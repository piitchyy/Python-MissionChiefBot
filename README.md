# Python Mission Chief Bot
A small bot for the game missionchief, on either the .com or .co.uk domains. Once you've provided it with a username and password and URL in the config file it will log in for you and run through the missions assigning vehicles. It will do so indefinitely.

To use download the code, install Python then open up a cmd and type in the following:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`-


Once done open the config.ini and replace corresponding lines with your account information, and enter the domain your account is registered such as `https://www.missionchief.co.uk/`

Once you're done, do the following in a cmd - it will run the bot for you.
`run missionchief_bot.py`
